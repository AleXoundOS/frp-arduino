# Contributing

The contributors are listed in [AUTHORS](AUTHORS) (add yourself).

We use the [C4.1 (Collective Code Construction Contract)](http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:22) process for contributions.

Comments on the process:

> A patch MUST compile cleanly and pass project self-tests on at least the
> principle target platform.

In our case, this means that `./test` should run without failure.
